# FAVE - Fluid Approximated Voxel Engine

FAVE is a simplified voxel engine for fluid simulation, written in C++ using OpenGL. It implements fluid dynamics using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, allowing for realistic fluid behavior in a voxel environment.

## Features

- **Fluid Simulation**: Realistic fluid dynamics based on the SPH algorithm.
- **Voxel-Based Rendering**: Efficient rendering of voxel-based environments.
- **OpenGL Integration**: Leverages OpenGL for high-performance graphics rendering.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjustable simulation parameters for fluid behavior.

## Getting Started

To get started with FAVE, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FAVE.git
   cd FAVE
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need:
   - OpenGL
   - GLFW
   - GLAD
   - GLM
   - STB

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Engine**:
   ```bash
   ./FAVE
   ```

## Usage

Once the engine is running, you can interact with the fluid simulation in real-time. Use the following controls:
- **Mouse Movement**: Control the camera view.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: WASD + SPACEBAR + CTRL. Use various keys to manipulate fluid parameters and rendering options (details to be provided in future documentation).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute to FAVE, please fork the repository and create a pull request.
